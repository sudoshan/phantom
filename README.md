# walors 

# this project is incomplete, meaning its progress is still on-going.

walors is an implementation of pywal colors in ghostty. unlike pywal, instead of changing tty colors, walors directly changes the theming on ghostty as per your currrent pywal colors.

walors most likely wont work on your computer initially and you will have to change the directory to your pywal colors yourself in order to get it to read your pywal colors.

background-opacity option will get removed everytime the script is initialised due to clashing of the options 'background' and 'background-opacity'.
