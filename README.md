# phantom

# this project is incomplete, meaning its progress is still on-going.

phantom is an implementation of pywal colors in ghostty. unlike pywal, instead of changing tty colors, phantom directly changes the theming on ghostty as per your currrent pywal colors.

phantom most likely wont work on your computer initially and you will have to change the directory to your pywal colors yourself in order to get it to read your pywal colors.

# if there are palettes defined in your ghostty config file initially, there shouldnt be any other settings after the color palettes in your config file, as those settings will be removed in order for phantom to work.
