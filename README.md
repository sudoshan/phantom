# phantom

# this project is incomplete, meaning its progress is still on-going.

phantom is an implementation of pywal colors in ghostty. unlike pywal, instead of changing tty colors, phantom directly changes the theming on ghostty as per your currrent pywal colors.

phantom most likely wont work on your computer initially and you will have to change the source code yourself in order to get it to read your pywal colors.
even if it starts reading colors, it wont change your config files in respect to your previous configuration.

# your previous configuration will be wiped if you run this script.
